Resources:
  [1] Python Software Foundation, “3.7.3 Documentation,” Python.org, 2019.
https://docs.python.org/3/
This site contains documentation on how to use and what the python language is
capable of. I will be referring to this site often as I write my code for my project.
[2] R. Python, “ChatterBot: Build a Chatbot With Python – Real Python,” realpython.com.
https://realpython.com/build-a-chatbot-python-chatterbot/
This site contains a step-by-step guide on how to build a chat-bot using python and
chatterbot. I will be following this guide and building the chatbot to further
understand how it functions and have a better understanding of how to build one on
my own.
[3] I. Vasilev, Python deep learning : exploring deep learning techniques and neural network
architectures with PyTorch, Keras, and TensorFlow. Birmingham, UK: Packt Publishing,
2019.
This book contains research and techniques on python neural networks and
different libraries that will be useful in writing code involving these. I will be using
this to better understand neural networks and how to implement them into my
code.
[4] “AI Chatbot | Complete Guide to build your AI Chatbot with NLP in Python,” Analytics
Vidhya, Oct. 25, 2021. https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2021/10/complete-guideto-build-your-aichatbot-with-nlp-in-python/
This site contains a guide on building a chatbot that uses NLP or natural language
processing. I will be following this guide to better understand how to implement
NLP and help decide if I want to include this function in my chatbot.
[5] “Building a rule-based chatbot in Python | Data Science Dojo,” datasciencedojo.com.
https://datasciencedojo.com/blog/rule-based-chatbot-in-python/
This site contains a blog that shows how to create a rule-based chatbot. I will be
using this as a starting point for my chatbot as it will be much simpler to code than
using NLP.
[6] “Craft Your Own Python AI ChatBot: A Comprehensive Guide to Harnessing NLP,”
blog.hubspot.com, Sep. 08, 2023. https://blog.hubspot.com/website/python-ai-chat-bot
This is another guide on building an AI chatbot however this site includes how to
implement the bot into a web browser. I will be following this guide and using the
knowledge I gained to be able to add web browser functionality to my bot.
[7] Stack Overflow, “Stack Overflow - Where Developers Learn, Share, & Build Careers,”
Stack Overflow, 2022. https://stackoverflow.com/
This site has many useful questions and answers for all things programming. If I get
stuck or do not understand a portion of what I am doing, I can search for answers on
this site or ask questions from the users.
[8] IBM, "IBM Machine Learning," https://www.ibm.com/topics/machine-learning.
This site breaks down and explains machine learning deep learning and neural
networks. I will be attempting to explain some of these concepts in my poster
myself.
[9] GeeksforGeeks, "Machine Learning," GeeksforGeeks,
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/machine-learning/.
This is another site that gives a basic overview of machine learning that will help me
to better explain to people what exactly machine learning is and how it is used.

research. Qual Quant 55, 1007–1025 (2021). https://doi.org/10.1007/s11135-020-01037-y
This article goes deeper into the algorithms that are used within machine learning
and neural networks that I will be using to further understand the process used and
be better able to explain it myself.

This book goes into the history of neural networks and how they were inspired to be
created which I will include in my poster to give people a further understanding of
neural networks and how they came to be.

This research paper dives into how using an AI based chatbot can affect how users
interact within the customer service realm. By using this research paper I can
further explain why I would be using this chatbot and how it could affect a business
to implement one on their own.
